        "chunk": "6 introduction examination of the range of symptoms present dsm can serve clinicians as a guide to identify the most prominent symptoms that should be assessed when diagnosing a disorder although some mental disorders may have welldefined boundaries around symptom clusters scien tific evidence now places many if not most disorders on a spectrum with closely related dis orders that have shared symptoms shared genetic and environmental risk factors and possibly shared neural substrates perhaps most strongly established for a subset of anxiety disorders by neuroimaging and animal models in short we have come to recognize that the boundaries between disorders are more porous than originally perceived many health profession and educational groups have been involved in the development and testing of dsm5 including physicians psychologists social workers nurses counselors epidemiologists statisticians neuroscientists and neuropsychologists finally patients fam ilies lawyers consumer organizations and advocacy groups have all participated in revising dsm5 by providing feedback on the mental disorders described in this volume their moni toring of the descriptions and explanatory text is essential to improve understanding reduce stigma and advance the treatment and eventual cures for these conditions a brief history the apa first published a predecessor of dsm in 1844 as a statistical classification of in stitutionalized mental patients it was designed to improve communication about the types of patients cared for in these hospitals this forerunner to dsm also was used as a component of the full us census after world war ii dsm evolved through four major editions into a diagnostic classification system for psychiatrists other physicians and other mental health professionals that described the essential features of the full range of mental disorders the current edition dsm5 builds on the goal of its predecessors most recently dsmivtr or text revision published in 2000 of providing guidelines for di agnoses that can inform treatment and management decisions dsm5 revision process in 1999 the apa launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of dsm based on emerging research that did not support the boundaries established for some mental disor ders this effort was coordinated with the world health organization who division of mental health the world psychiatric association and the national institute of mental health nimh in the form of several conferences the p roceedings of which were published in 2002 in a monograph entitled a research agenda for dsmv thereafter from 2003 to 2008 a cooperative agreement with the apa and the who was supported by the nimh the na tional institute on drug abuse nida and the national institute on alcoholism and alco hol abuse niaaa to convene 13 international dsm5 research planning conferences involving 400 participants from 39 countries to review the world literature in specific diag nostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both dsm5 and the international classi fication of diseases 11th revision icd11 reports from these conferences formed the basis for future dsm5 task force reviews and set the stage for the new edition of dsm in 2006 the apa named david j kupfer md as chair and darrel a regier md mph as vicechair of the dsm5 task force they were charged with recommending chairs for the 13 diagnostic work groups and additional task force members with a multi disciplinary range of expertise who would oversee the development of dsm5 an addi tional vetting process was initiated by the apa board of trustees to disclose sources of income and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task force and work group members the full disclosure of all income and research grants from commercial sources including the phar maceutical industry in the previous 3 years the imposition of an income cap from all com mercial sources and the publication of disclosures on a web site set a new standard for the introduction 7 field thereafter the task force of 28 members was approved in 2007 and appointments of more than 130 work group members were approved in 2008 more than 400 additional work group advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in the pro cess a clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental disorders was central to the efforts of the task force and the work groups this vision emerged as the task force and work groups recounted the history of dsmivs classification its current strengths and limitations and strategic directions for its revision an intensive 6year pro cess involved conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses publishing research reports in scientific journals developing draft diagnostic criteria posting preliminary drafts on the dsm5 web site for public comment presenting preliminary findings at pro fessional meetings performing field trials and revising criteria and text proposals for revisions proposals for th e revision of dsm5 diagnostic criteria were developed by members of the work groups on the basis of rationale scope of change expected impact on clinical man agement and public health strength of the supporting research evidence overall clarity and clinical utility proposals encompassed changes to diagnostic criteria the addition of new disorders subtypes and specifiers and the deletion of existing disorders in the proposals for revisions strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and no sology were first identified novel scientific findings over the previous two decades were considered leading to the creation of a research plan to assess potential changes through literature reviews and secondary data analyses four principles guided the draft revisions 1 dsm5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians and revisions must be feasible for routine clinical practice 2 recommendations for revisions should be guided by research evidence 3 where possible continuity should be maintained with previous editions of dsm and 4 no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of change between dsmiv and dsm5 building on the initial literature reviews work groups identified key issues within their diagnostic areas work groups also examined broader methodological concerns such as the presence of contradictory findings within the literature development of a re fined definition of mental disorder crosscutting issues relevant to all disorders and the revision of disorders categorized in dsmiv as not otherwise specified inclusion of a proposal for revision in section ii was informed by consideration of its advantages and disadvantages for public health and clinical utility the strength of the evidence and the magnitude of the change new diagnoses and disorder subtypes and specifiers were sub ject to additional stipulations such as demonstration of reliability ie the degree to which two clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient dis orders with low clinical utility and weak validity were considered for deletion placement of conditions in conditions for further study in section iii was contingent on the amount of empirical evidence generated on the diagnosis diagnostic reliability or valid ity presence of clear clinical need and potential benefit in advancing research dsm5 field trials the use of field trials to empirically demonstrate reliability was a noteworthy improvement in troduced in dsmiii the design and implementation strategy of the dsm5 field trials rep resent several changes over approaches used for dsmiii and dsmiv particularly in obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability estimates a statistical measure that assesses level of agreement between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates in the context of clinical settings with high levels of diagnostic comorbidity for dsm5 field trials were extended by using two distinctive designs one in large diverse medicalacademic settings and the other in routine clinical practices the former capitalized on the need for large sample sizes to test hypotheses on reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a 8 introduction variety of patient populations the latter supplied valuable information about how proposed revisions performed in everyday clinical settings among a diverse sample of dsm users it is anticipated that future clinical and basic research studies will focus on the validity of the re vised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features of these disor ders including those now being explored by the nimh research domain criteria initiative the medicalacademic field trials were conducted at 11 north american medicalacademic sites and assessed the reliability feasibility and clinical utility of select revisions with priority given to those that represented the greatest degree of change from dsmiv or those potentially having the greatest public health impact the full clinical patient populations coming to each site were screened for dsmiv diagnoses or qualifying symptoms likely to predict several spe cific dsm5 disorders of interest stratified samples of four to seven specific disorders plus a stratum containing a representative sample of all other diagnoses were identified for each site patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a clinical interview by a cli nician blind to the diagnosis followed by a second interview with a clinician blind to previous diagnoses patients first filled out a computerassisted inventory of crosscutting symptoms in more than a dozen psychological domains these inventories were scored by a central server and results were provided to clinicians before they conducted a typical clinical interview with no structured protocol clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying criteria on a computerassisted dsm5 diagnostic checklist determine diagnoses score the severity of the diag nosis and submit all data to the central webbased server this study design allowed the calculation of the degree to which two independent clinicians could agree on a diagnosis us ing the intraclass kappa statistic and the agreement of a single patient or two different clini cians on two separate ratings of crosscutting symptoms personality traits disability and diagnostic severity measures using intraclass correlation coefficients along with information on the precision of these estimates of reliability it was also possible to assess the prevalence rates of both dsmiv and dsm5 conditions in the respective clinical populations the routine clinical practice field trials involved recruitment of individual psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians a volunteer sample was recruited that included gener alist and specialty psychiatrists psychologists licensed clinical social workers counselors marriage and family therapists and advanced practice psychiatric mental health nurses the field trials provided exposure of the proposed dsm5 diagnoses and dimensional mea sures to a wide range of clinicians to assess their feasibility and clinical utility public and professional review in 2010 the apa launched a unique web site to facilitate public and professional input into dsm5 all draft diagnostic criteria and proposed changes in organization were posted on wwwdsm5org for a 2month comment period feedback totaled more than 8000 submis sions which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13 work groups whose members where appropriate integrated questions and comments into discussions of draft revisions and plans for field trial testing after revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposed chapter organization a second posting occurred in 2011 work groups considered feedback from both web postings and the results of the dsm5 field trials when drafting proposed final criteria which were posted on the web site for a third and final time in 2012 these three iterations of external review produced more than 13000 individually signed com ments on the web site that were received and reviewed by the work groups plus thousands of organized petition signers for and against some proposed revisions all of which allowed the task force to actively address concerns of dsm users as well as patients and advocacy groups and ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority expert review the members of the 13 work groups representing expertise in their respective areas col laborated with advisors and reviewers under the overall direction of the dsm5 task introduction 9 force to draft the diagnostic criteria and accompanying text this effort was supported by a team of apa division of research staff and developed through a network of text coor dinators from each work group the preparation of the text was coordinated by the text editor working in close collaboration with the work groups and under the direction of the task force chairs the scientific review committee src was established to provide a sci entific peer review process that was external to that of the work groups the src chair vicechair and six committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to which the proposed changes from dsmiv could be supported with scientific evidence each proposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of evidence for change pre pared by the work group and accompanied by a summary of supportive data organized around validators for the proposed diagnostic criteria ie antecedent validators such as familial aggregation concurrent validators such as biological markers and prospective validators such as response to treatment or course of illness the submissions were re viewed by the src and scored according to the strength of the supportive scientific data other justifications for change such as those arising from clinical experience or need or from a conceptual reframing of diagnostic categories were generally seen as outside the purview of the src the reviewers scores which varied substantially across the different proposals and an accompanying brief commentary were then returned to the apa board of trustees and the work groups for consideration and response the clinical and public health committee cphc composed of a chair vicechair and six members was appointed to consider additional clinical utility public health and log ical clarification issues for criteria that had not yet accumulated the type or level of evi dence deemed sufficient for change by the src this review process was particularly important for dsmiv disorders with known deficiencies for which proposed remedies had neither been previously considered in the dsm revision process nor been subjected to replicated research studies these selected disorders were evaluated by four to five exter nal reviewers and the blinded results were reviewed by cphc members who in turn made recommendations to the apa board of trustees and the work groups forensic reviews by the member",

        "chunk": "6 introduction examination of the range of symptoms present dsm can serve clinicians as a guide to identify the most prominent symptoms that should be assessed when diagnosing a disorder although some mental disorders may have welldefined boundaries around symptom clusters scien tific evidence now places many if not most disorders on a spectrum with closely related dis orders that have shared symptoms shared genetic and environmental risk factors and possibly shared neural substrates perhaps most strongly established for a subset of anxiety disorders by neuroimaging and animal models in short we have come to recognize that the boundaries between disorders are more porous than originally perceived many health profession and educational groups have been involved in the development and testing of dsm5 including physicians psychologists social workers nurses counselors epidemiologists statisticians neuroscientists and neuropsychologists finally patients fam ilies lawyers consumer organizations and advocacy groups have all participated in revising dsm5 by providing feedback on the mental disorders described in this volume their moni toring of the descriptions and explanatory text is essential to improve understanding reduce stigma and advance the treatment and eventual cures for these conditions a brief history the apa first published a predecessor of dsm in 1844 as a statistical classification of in stitutionalized mental patients it was designed to improve communication about the types of patients cared for in these hospitals this forerunner to dsm also was used as a component of the full us census after world war ii dsm evolved through four major editions into a diagnostic classification system for psychiatrists other physicians and other mental health professionals that described the essential features of the full range of mental disorders the current edition dsm5 builds on the goal of its predecessors most recently dsmivtr or text revision published in 2000 of providing guidelines for di agnoses that can inform treatment and management decisions dsm5 revision process in 1999 the apa launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of dsm based on emerging research that did not support the boundaries established for some mental disor ders this effort was coordinated with the world health organization who division of mental health the world psychiatric association and the national institute of mental health nimh in the form of several conferences the p roceedings of which were published in 2002 in a monograph entitled a research agenda for dsmv thereafter from 2003 to 2008 a cooperative agreement with the apa and the who was supported by the nimh the na tional institute on drug abuse nida and the national institute on alcoholism and alco hol abuse niaaa to convene 13 international dsm5 research planning conferences involving 400 participants from 39 countries to review the world literature in specific diag nostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both dsm5 and the international classi fication of diseases 11th revision icd11 reports from these conferences formed the basis for future dsm5 task force reviews and set the stage for the new edition of dsm in 2006 the apa named david j kupfer md as chair and darrel a regier md mph as vicechair of the dsm5 task force they were charged with recommending chairs for the 13 diagnostic work groups and additional task force members with a multi disciplinary range of expertise who would oversee the development of dsm5 an addi tional vetting process was initiated by the apa board of trustees to disclose sources of income and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task force and work group members the full disclosure of all income and research grants from commercial sources including the phar maceutical industry in the previous 3 years the imposition of an income cap from all com mercial sources and the publication of disclosures on a web site set a new standard for the introduction 7 field thereafter the task force of 28 members was approved in 2007 and appointments of more than 130 work group members were approved in 2008 more than 400 additional work group advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in the pro cess a clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental disorders was central to the efforts of the task force and the work groups this vision emerged as the task force and work groups recounted the history of dsmivs classification its current strengths and limitations and strategic directions for its revision an intensive 6year pro cess involved conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses publishing research reports in scientific journals developing draft diagnostic criteria posting preliminary drafts on the dsm5 web site for public comment presenting preliminary findings at pro fessional meetings performing field trials and revising criteria and text proposals for revisions proposals for th e revision of dsm5 diagnostic criteria were developed by members of the work groups on the basis of rationale scope of change expected impact on clinical man agement and public health strength of the supporting research evidence overall clarity and clinical utility proposals encompassed changes to diagnostic criteria the addition of new disorders subtypes and specifiers and the deletion of existing disorders in the proposals for revisions strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and no sology were first identified novel scientific findings over the previous two decades were considered leading to the creation of a research plan to assess potential changes through literature reviews and secondary data analyses four principles guided the draft revisions 1 dsm5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians and revisions must be feasible for routine clinical practice 2 recommendations for revisions should be guided by research evidence 3 where possible continuity should be maintained with previous editions of dsm and 4 no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of change between dsmiv and dsm5 building on the initial literature reviews work groups identified key issues within their diagnostic areas work groups also examined broader methodological concerns such as the presence of contradictory findings within the literature development of a re fined definition of mental disorder crosscutting issues relevant to all disorders and the revision of disorders categorized in dsmiv as not otherwise specified inclusion of a proposal for revision in section ii was informed by consideration of its advantages and disadvantages for public health and clinical utility the strength of the evidence and the magnitude of the change new diagnoses and disorder subtypes and specifiers were sub ject to additional stipulations such as demonstration of reliability ie the degree to which two clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient dis orders with low clinical utility and weak validity were considered for deletion placement of conditions in conditions for further study in section iii was contingent on the amount of empirical evidence generated on the diagnosis diagnostic reliability or valid ity presence of clear clinical need and potential benefit in advancing research dsm5 field trials the use of field trials to empirically demonstrate reliability was a noteworthy improvement in troduced in dsmiii the design and implementation strategy of the dsm5 field trials rep resent several changes over approaches used for dsmiii and dsmiv particularly in obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability estimates a statistical measure that assesses level of agreement between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates in the context of clinical settings with high levels of diagnostic comorbidity for dsm5 field trials were extended by using two distinctive designs one in large diverse medicalacademic settings and the other in routine clinical practices the former capitalized on the need for large sample sizes to test hypotheses on reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a 8 introduction variety of patient populations the latter supplied valuable information about how proposed revisions performed in everyday clinical settings among a diverse sample of dsm users it is anticipated that future clinical and basic research studies will focus on the validity of the re vised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features of these disor ders including those now being explored by the nimh research domain criteria initiative the medicalacademic field trials were conducted at 11 north american medicalacademic sites and assessed the reliability feasibility and clinical utility of select revisions with priority given to those that represented the greatest degree of change from dsmiv or those potentially having the greatest public health impact the full clinical patient populations coming to each site were screened for dsmiv diagnoses or qualifying symptoms likely to predict several spe cific dsm5 disorders of interest stratified samples of four to seven specific disorders plus a stratum containing a representative sample of all other diagnoses were identified for each site patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a clinical interview by a cli nician blind to the diagnosis followed by a second interview with a clinician blind to previous diagnoses patients first filled out a computerassisted inventory of crosscutting symptoms in more than a dozen psychological domains these inventories were scored by a central server and results were provided to clinicians before they conducted a typical clinical interview with no structured protocol clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying criteria on a computerassisted dsm5 diagnostic checklist determine diagnoses score the severity of the diag nosis and submit all data to the central webbased server this study design allowed the calculation of the degree to which two independent clinicians could agree on a diagnosis us ing the intraclass kappa statistic and the agreement of a single patient or two different clini cians on two separate ratings of crosscutting symptoms personality traits disability and diagnostic severity measures using intraclass correlation coefficients along with information on the precision of these estimates of reliability it was also possible to assess the prevalence rates of both dsmiv and dsm5 conditions in the respective clinical populations the routine clinical practice field trials involved recruitment of individual psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians a volunteer sample was recruited that included gener alist and specialty psychiatrists psychologists licensed clinical social workers counselors marriage and family therapists and advanced practice psychiatric mental health nurses the field trials provided exposure of the proposed dsm5 diagnoses and dimensional mea sures to a wide range of clinicians to assess their feasibility and clinical utility public and professional review in 2010 the apa launched a unique web site to facilitate public and professional input into dsm5 all draft diagnostic criteria and proposed changes in organization were posted on wwwdsm5org for a 2month comment period feedback totaled more than 8000 submis sions which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13 work groups whose members where appropriate integrated questions and comments into discussions of draft revisions and plans for field trial testing after revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposed chapter organization a second posting occurred in 2011 work groups considered feedback from both web postings and the results of the dsm5 field trials when drafting proposed final criteria which were posted on the web site for a third and final time in 2012 these three iterations of external review produced more than 13000 individually signed com ments on the web site that were received and reviewed by the work groups plus thousands of organized petition signers for and against some proposed revisions all of which allowed the task force to actively address concerns of dsm users as well as patients and advocacy groups and ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority expert review the members of the 13 work groups representing expertise in their respective areas col laborated with advisors and reviewers under the overall direction of the dsm5 task introduction 9 force to draft the diagnostic criteria and accompanying text this effort was supported by a team of apa division of research staff and developed through a network of text coor dinators from each work group the preparation of the text was coordinated by the text editor working in close collaboration with the work groups and under the direction of the task force chairs the scientific review committee src was established to provide a sci entific peer review process that was external to that of the work groups the src chair vicechair and six committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to which the proposed changes from dsmiv could be supported with scientific evidence each proposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of evidence for change pre pared by the work group and accompanied by a summary of supportive data organized around validators for the proposed diagnostic criteria ie antecedent validators such as familial aggregation concurrent validators such as biological markers and prospective validators such as response to treatment or course of illness the submissions were re viewed by the src and scored according to the strength of the supportive scientific data other justifications for change such as those arising from clinical experience or need or from a conceptual reframing of diagnostic categories were generally seen as outside the purview of the src the reviewers scores which varied substantially across the different proposals and an accompanying brief commentary were then returned to the apa board of trustees and the work groups for consideration and response the clinical and public health committee cphc composed of a chair vicechair and six members was appointed to consider additional clinical utility public health and log ical clarification issues for criteria that had not yet accumulated the type or level of evi dence deemed sufficient for change by the src this review process was particularly important for dsmiv disorders with known deficiencies for which proposed remedies had neither been previously considered in the dsm revision process nor been subjected to replicated research studies these selected disorders were evaluated by four to five exter nal reviewers and the blinded results were reviewed by cphc members who in turn made recommendations to the apa board of trustees and the work groups forensic reviews by the member s of the apa council on psychiatry and law were con ducted for disorders frequently appearing in forensic environments and ones with high potential for influencing civil and criminal judgments in courtroom settings work groups also added forensic experts as advisors in pertinent areas to complement expertise pro vided by the council on psychiatry and law the work groups themselves were charged with the responsibility to review the entire re search literature surrounding a diagnostic area including old revised and new diagnostic cri teria in an intensive 6year review process to assess the pros and cons of making either small iterative changes or major conceptual changes to address the inevitable reification that occurs with diagnostic conceptual approaches that persist over several decades such changes in cluded the merger of previously separate diagnostic areas into more dimensional spectra such as that which occurred with autism spectrum disorder substance use disorders sexual dys functions and somatic symptom and related disorders other changes included correcting flaws that had become apparent over time in the choice of operational criteria for some disor ders these types of changes posed particular challenges to the src and cphc review pro cesses which were not constructed to evaluate the validity of dsmiv diagnostic criteria however the dsm5 task force which had reviewed proposed changes and had responsi bility for reviewing the text describing each disorder contemporaneously with the work groups during this period was in a unique position to render an informed judgment on the sci entific merits of such revisions furthermore many of these major changes were subject to field trial testing although comprehensive testing of all proposed changes could not be accommo dated by such testing because of time limitations and availability of resources a final recommendation from the task force was then provided to the apa board of trustees and the apa assemblys committee on dsm5 to consider some of the clinical utility and feasibility features of the proposed revisions the assembly is a deliberative 10 introduction body of the apa representing the district branches and wider membership that is com posed of psychiatrists from throughout the united states who provide geographic prac tice size and interestbased diversity the committee on dsm5 is a committee made up of a diverse group of assembly leaders following all of the preceding review steps an executive summi",

        "chunk": "6 introduction examination of the range of symptoms present dsm can serve clinicians as a guide to identify the most prominent symptoms that should be assessed when diagnosing a disorder although some mental disorders may have welldefined boundaries around symptom clusters scien tific evidence now places many if not most disorders on a spectrum with closely related dis orders that have shared symptoms shared genetic and environmental risk factors and possibly shared neural substrates perhaps most strongly established for a subset of anxiety disorders by neuroimaging and animal models in short we have come to recognize that the boundaries between disorders are more porous than originally perceived many health profession and educational groups have been involved in the development and testing of dsm5 including physicians psychologists social workers nurses counselors epidemiologists statisticians neuroscientists and neuropsychologists finally patients fam ilies lawyers consumer organizations and advocacy groups have all participated in revising dsm5 by providing feedback on the mental disorders described in this volume their moni toring of the descriptions and explanatory text is essential to improve understanding reduce stigma and advance the treatment and eventual cures for these conditions a brief history the apa first published a predecessor of dsm in 1844 as a statistical classification of in stitutionalized mental patients it was designed to improve communication about the types of patients cared for in these hospitals this forerunner to dsm also was used as a component of the full us census after world war ii dsm evolved through four major editions into a diagnostic classification system for psychiatrists other physicians and other mental health professionals that described the essential features of the full range of mental disorders the current edition dsm5 builds on the goal of its predecessors most recently dsmivtr or text revision published in 2000 of providing guidelines for di agnoses that can inform treatment and management decisions dsm5 revision process in 1999 the apa launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of dsm based on emerging research that did not support the boundaries established for some mental disor ders this effort was coordinated with the world health organization who division of mental health the world psychiatric association and the national institute of mental health nimh in the form of several conferences the p roceedings of which were published in 2002 in a monograph entitled a research agenda for dsmv thereafter from 2003 to 2008 a cooperative agreement with the apa and the who was supported by the nimh the na tional institute on drug abuse nida and the national institute on alcoholism and alco hol abuse niaaa to convene 13 international dsm5 research planning conferences involving 400 participants from 39 countries to review the world literature in specific diag nostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both dsm5 and the international classi fication of diseases 11th revision icd11 reports from these conferences formed the basis for future dsm5 task force reviews and set the stage for the new edition of dsm in 2006 the apa named david j kupfer md as chair and darrel a regier md mph as vicechair of the dsm5 task force they were charged with recommending chairs for the 13 diagnostic work groups and additional task force members with a multi disciplinary range of expertise who would oversee the development of dsm5 an addi tional vetting process was initiated by the apa board of trustees to disclose sources of income and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task force and work group members the full disclosure of all income and research grants from commercial sources including the phar maceutical industry in the previous 3 years the imposition of an income cap from all com mercial sources and the publication of disclosures on a web site set a new standard for the introduction 7 field thereafter the task force of 28 members was approved in 2007 and appointments of more than 130 work group members were approved in 2008 more than 400 additional work group advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in the pro cess a clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental disorders was central to the efforts of the task force and the work groups this vision emerged as the task force and work groups recounted the history of dsmivs classification its current strengths and limitations and strategic directions for its revision an intensive 6year pro cess involved conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses publishing research reports in scientific journals developing draft diagnostic criteria posting preliminary drafts on the dsm5 web site for public comment presenting preliminary findings at pro fessional meetings performing field trials and revising criteria and text proposals for revisions proposals for th e revision of dsm5 diagnostic criteria were developed by members of the work groups on the basis of rationale scope of change expected impact on clinical man agement and public health strength of the supporting research evidence overall clarity and clinical utility proposals encompassed changes to diagnostic criteria the addition of new disorders subtypes and specifiers and the deletion of existing disorders in the proposals for revisions strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and no sology were first identified novel scientific findings over the previous two decades were considered leading to the creation of a research plan to assess potential changes through literature reviews and secondary data analyses four principles guided the draft revisions 1 dsm5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians and revisions must be feasible for routine clinical practice 2 recommendations for revisions should be guided by research evidence 3 where possible continuity should be maintained with previous editions of dsm and 4 no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of change between dsmiv and dsm5 building on the initial literature reviews work groups identified key issues within their diagnostic areas work groups also examined broader methodological concerns such as the presence of contradictory findings within the literature development of a re fined definition of mental disorder crosscutting issues relevant to all disorders and the revision of disorders categorized in dsmiv as not otherwise specified inclusion of a proposal for revision in section ii was informed by consideration of its advantages and disadvantages for public health and clinical utility the strength of the evidence and the magnitude of the change new diagnoses and disorder subtypes and specifiers were sub ject to additional stipulations such as demonstration of reliability ie the degree to which two clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient dis orders with low clinical utility and weak validity were considered for deletion placement of conditions in conditions for further study in section iii was contingent on the amount of empirical evidence generated on the diagnosis diagnostic reliability or valid ity presence of clear clinical need and potential benefit in advancing research dsm5 field trials the use of field trials to empirically demonstrate reliability was a noteworthy improvement in troduced in dsmiii the design and implementation strategy of the dsm5 field trials rep resent several changes over approaches used for dsmiii and dsmiv particularly in obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability estimates a statistical measure that assesses level of agreement between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates in the context of clinical settings with high levels of diagnostic comorbidity for dsm5 field trials were extended by using two distinctive designs one in large diverse medicalacademic settings and the other in routine clinical practices the former capitalized on the need for large sample sizes to test hypotheses on reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a 8 introduction variety of patient populations the latter supplied valuable information about how proposed revisions performed in everyday clinical settings among a diverse sample of dsm users it is anticipated that future clinical and basic research studies will focus on the validity of the re vised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features of these disor ders including those now being explored by the nimh research domain criteria initiative the medicalacademic field trials were conducted at 11 north american medicalacademic sites and assessed the reliability feasibility and clinical utility of select revisions with priority given to those that represented the greatest degree of change from dsmiv or those potentially having the greatest public health impact the full clinical patient populations coming to each site were screened for dsmiv diagnoses or qualifying symptoms likely to predict several spe cific dsm5 disorders of interest stratified samples of four to seven specific disorders plus a stratum containing a representative sample of all other diagnoses were identified for each site patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a clinical interview by a cli nician blind to the diagnosis followed by a second interview with a clinician blind to previous diagnoses patients first filled out a computerassisted inventory of crosscutting symptoms in more than a dozen psychological domains these inventories were scored by a central server and results were provided to clinicians before they conducted a typical clinical interview with no structured protocol clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying criteria on a computerassisted dsm5 diagnostic checklist determine diagnoses score the severity of the diag nosis and submit all data to the central webbased server this study design allowed the calculation of the degree to which two independent clinicians could agree on a diagnosis us ing the intraclass kappa statistic and the agreement of a single patient or two different clini cians on two separate ratings of crosscutting symptoms personality traits disability and diagnostic severity measures using intraclass correlation coefficients along with information on the precision of these estimates of reliability it was also possible to assess the prevalence rates of both dsmiv and dsm5 conditions in the respective clinical populations the routine clinical practice field trials involved recruitment of individual psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians a volunteer sample was recruited that included gener alist and specialty psychiatrists psychologists licensed clinical social workers counselors marriage and family therapists and advanced practice psychiatric mental health nurses the field trials provided exposure of the proposed dsm5 diagnoses and dimensional mea sures to a wide range of clinicians to assess their feasibility and clinical utility public and professional review in 2010 the apa launched a unique web site to facilitate public and professional input into dsm5 all draft diagnostic criteria and proposed changes in organization were posted on wwwdsm5org for a 2month comment period feedback totaled more than 8000 submis sions which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13 work groups whose members where appropriate integrated questions and comments into discussions of draft revisions and plans for field trial testing after revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposed chapter organization a second posting occurred in 2011 work groups considered feedback from both web postings and the results of the dsm5 field trials when drafting proposed final criteria which were posted on the web site for a third and final time in 2012 these three iterations of external review produced more than 13000 individually signed com ments on the web site that were received and reviewed by the work groups plus thousands of organized petition signers for and against some proposed revisions all of which allowed the task force to actively address concerns of dsm users as well as patients and advocacy groups and ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority expert review the members of the 13 work groups representing expertise in their respective areas col laborated with advisors and reviewers under the overall direction of the dsm5 task introduction 9 force to draft the diagnostic criteria and accompanying text this effort was supported by a team of apa division of research staff and developed through a network of text coor dinators from each work group the preparation of the text was coordinated by the text editor working in close collaboration with the work groups and under the direction of the task force chairs the scientific review committee src was established to provide a sci entific peer review process that was external to that of the work groups the src chair vicechair and six committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to which the proposed changes from dsmiv could be supported with scientific evidence each proposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of evidence for change pre pared by the work group and accompanied by a summary of supportive data organized around validators for the proposed diagnostic criteria ie antecedent validators such as familial aggregation concurrent validators such as biological markers and prospective validators such as response to treatment or course of illness the submissions were re viewed by the src and scored according to the strength of the supportive scientific data other justifications for change such as those arising from clinical experience or need or from a conceptual reframing of diagnostic categories were generally seen as outside the purview of the src the reviewers scores which varied substantially across the different proposals and an accompanying brief commentary were then returned to the apa board of trustees and the work groups for consideration and response the clinical and public health committee cphc composed of a chair vicechair and six members was appointed to consider additional clinical utility public health and log ical clarification issues for criteria that had not yet accumulated the type or level of evi dence deemed sufficient for change by the src this review process was particularly important for dsmiv disorders with known deficiencies for which proposed remedies had neither been previously considered in the dsm revision process nor been subjected to replicated research studies these selected disorders were evaluated by four to five exter nal reviewers and the blinded results were reviewed by cphc members who in turn made recommendations to the apa board of trustees and the work groups forensic reviews by the member s of the apa council on psychiatry and law were con ducted for disorders frequently appearing in forensic environments and ones with high potential for influencing civil and criminal judgments in courtroom settings work groups also added forensic experts as advisors in pertinent areas to complement expertise pro vided by the council on psychiatry and law the work groups themselves were charged with the responsibility to review the entire re search literature surrounding a diagnostic area including old revised and new diagnostic cri teria in an intensive 6year review process to assess the pros and cons of making either small iterative changes or major conceptual changes to address the inevitable reification that occurs with diagnostic conceptual approaches that persist over several decades such changes in cluded the merger of previously separate diagnostic areas into more dimensional spectra such as that which occurred with autism spectrum disorder substance use disorders sexual dys functions and somatic symptom and related disorders other changes included correcting flaws that had become apparent over time in the choice of operational criteria for some disor ders these types of changes posed particular challenges to the src and cphc review pro cesses which were not constructed to evaluate the validity of dsmiv diagnostic criteria however the dsm5 task force which had reviewed proposed changes and had responsi bility for reviewing the text describing each disorder contemporaneously with the work groups during this period was in a unique position to render an informed judgment on the sci entific merits of such revisions furthermore many of these major changes were subject to field trial testing although comprehensive testing of all proposed changes could not be accommo dated by such testing because of time limitations and availability of resources a final recommendation from the task force was then provided to the apa board of trustees and the apa assemblys committee on dsm5 to consider some of the clinical utility and feasibility features of the proposed revisions the assembly is a deliberative 10 introduction body of the apa representing the district branches and wider membership that is com posed of psychiatrists from throughout the united states who provide geographic prac tice size and interestbased diversity the committee on dsm5 is a committee made up of a diverse group of assembly leaders following all of the preceding review steps an executive summi t committee session was held to consolidate input from review and assembly committee chairs task force chairs a forensic advisor and a statistical advisor for a preliminary review of each disor der by the assembly and apa board of trustees executive committees this preceded a preliminary review by the full apa board of trustees the assembly voted in november 2012 to recommend that the board approve the publication of dsm5 and the apa board of trustees approved its publication in december 2012 the many experts reviewers and advisors who contributed to this process are listed in the appendix organizational structure the individual disorder definitions that constitute the operationalized sets of diagnostic criteria provide the core of dsm5 for clinical and research purposes these criteria have been subjected to scientific review albeit to varying degrees and many disorders have un dergone field testing for interrater reliability in contrast the classification of disorders the way in which disorders are grouped which provides a highlevel organization for the man ual has not generally been thought of as scientifically significant despite the fact that judg ments had to be made when disorders were initially divided into chapters for dsmiii dsm is a medical classification of disorders and as such serves as a historically deter mined cognitive schema imposed on clinical and scientific information to increase its com prehensibility and utility not surprisingly as the foundational science that ultimately led to dsmiii has approached a halfcentury in age challenges have begun to emerge for cli nicians and scientists alike that are inherent in the dsm structure rather than in the de scription of any single disorder these challenges include high rates of comorbidity within and across dsm chapters an excessive use of and need to rely on not otherwise specified nos criteria and a growing inability to integrate dsm disorders with the results of ge netic studies and other scientific findings as the apa and the who began to plan their respective revisions of the dsm and the international classification of disorders icd both considered the possibility of improving clinical utility eg by helping to explain apparent comorbidity and facilitating scientific investigation by rethinking the organizational structures of both publications in a linear system designated by alphanumeric codes that sequence chapters according to some ra tional and relational structure it was critical to",

        "chunk": "6 introduction examination of the range of symptoms present dsm can serve clinicians as a guide to identify the most prominent symptoms that should be assessed when diagnosing a disorder although some mental disorders may have welldefined boundaries around symptom clusters scien tific evidence now places many if not most disorders on a spectrum with closely related dis orders that have shared symptoms shared genetic and environmental risk factors and possibly shared neural substrates perhaps most strongly established for a subset of anxiety disorders by neuroimaging and animal models in short we have come to recognize that the boundaries between disorders are more porous than originally perceived many health profession and educational groups have been involved in the development and testing of dsm5 including physicians psychologists social workers nurses counselors epidemiologists statisticians neuroscientists and neuropsychologists finally patients fam ilies lawyers consumer organizations and advocacy groups have all participated in revising dsm5 by providing feedback on the mental disorders described in this volume their moni toring of the descriptions and explanatory text is essential to improve understanding reduce stigma and advance the treatment and eventual cures for these conditions a brief history the apa first published a predecessor of dsm in 1844 as a statistical classification of in stitutionalized mental patients it was designed to improve communication about the types of patients cared for in these hospitals this forerunner to dsm also was used as a component of the full us census after world war ii dsm evolved through four major editions into a diagnostic classification system for psychiatrists other physicians and other mental health professionals that described the essential features of the full range of mental disorders the current edition dsm5 builds on the goal of its predecessors most recently dsmivtr or text revision published in 2000 of providing guidelines for di agnoses that can inform treatment and management decisions dsm5 revision process in 1999 the apa launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of dsm based on emerging research that did not support the boundaries established for some mental disor ders this effort was coordinated with the world health organization who division of mental health the world psychiatric association and the national institute of mental health nimh in the form of several conferences the p roceedings of which were published in 2002 in a monograph entitled a research agenda for dsmv thereafter from 2003 to 2008 a cooperative agreement with the apa and the who was supported by the nimh the na tional institute on drug abuse nida and the national institute on alcoholism and alco hol abuse niaaa to convene 13 international dsm5 research planning conferences involving 400 participants from 39 countries to review the world literature in specific diag nostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both dsm5 and the international classi fication of diseases 11th revision icd11 reports from these conferences formed the basis for future dsm5 task force reviews and set the stage for the new edition of dsm in 2006 the apa named david j kupfer md as chair and darrel a regier md mph as vicechair of the dsm5 task force they were charged with recommending chairs for the 13 diagnostic work groups and additional task force members with a multi disciplinary range of expertise who would oversee the development of dsm5 an addi tional vetting process was initiated by the apa board of trustees to disclose sources of income and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task force and work group members the full disclosure of all income and research grants from commercial sources including the phar maceutical industry in the previous 3 years the imposition of an income cap from all com mercial sources and the publication of disclosures on a web site set a new standard for the introduction 7 field thereafter the task force of 28 members was approved in 2007 and appointments of more than 130 work group members were approved in 2008 more than 400 additional work group advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in the pro cess a clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental disorders was central to the efforts of the task force and the work groups this vision emerged as the task force and work groups recounted the history of dsmivs classification its current strengths and limitations and strategic directions for its revision an intensive 6year pro cess involved conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses publishing research reports in scientific journals developing draft diagnostic criteria posting preliminary drafts on the dsm5 web site for public comment presenting preliminary findings at pro fessional meetings performing field trials and revising criteria and text proposals for revisions proposals for th e revision of dsm5 diagnostic criteria were developed by members of the work groups on the basis of rationale scope of change expected impact on clinical man agement and public health strength of the supporting research evidence overall clarity and clinical utility proposals encompassed changes to diagnostic criteria the addition of new disorders subtypes and specifiers and the deletion of existing disorders in the proposals for revisions strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and no sology were first identified novel scientific findings over the previous two decades were considered leading to the creation of a research plan to assess potential changes through literature reviews and secondary data analyses four principles guided the draft revisions 1 dsm5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians and revisions must be feasible for routine clinical practice 2 recommendations for revisions should be guided by research evidence 3 where possible continuity should be maintained with previous editions of dsm and 4 no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of change between dsmiv and dsm5 building on the initial literature reviews work groups identified key issues within their diagnostic areas work groups also examined broader methodological concerns such as the presence of contradictory findings within the literature development of a re fined definition of mental disorder crosscutting issues relevant to all disorders and the revision of disorders categorized in dsmiv as not otherwise specified inclusion of a proposal for revision in section ii was informed by consideration of its advantages and disadvantages for public health and clinical utility the strength of the evidence and the magnitude of the change new diagnoses and disorder subtypes and specifiers were sub ject to additional stipulations such as demonstration of reliability ie the degree to which two clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient dis orders with low clinical utility and weak validity were considered for deletion placement of conditions in conditions for further study in section iii was contingent on the amount of empirical evidence generated on the diagnosis diagnostic reliability or valid ity presence of clear clinical need and potential benefit in advancing research dsm5 field trials the use of field trials to empirically demonstrate reliability was a noteworthy improvement in troduced in dsmiii the design and implementation strategy of the dsm5 field trials rep resent several changes over approaches used for dsmiii and dsmiv particularly in obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability estimates a statistical measure that assesses level of agreement between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates in the context of clinical settings with high levels of diagnostic comorbidity for dsm5 field trials were extended by using two distinctive designs one in large diverse medicalacademic settings and the other in routine clinical practices the former capitalized on the need for large sample sizes to test hypotheses on reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a 8 introduction variety of patient populations the latter supplied valuable information about how proposed revisions performed in everyday clinical settings among a diverse sample of dsm users it is anticipated that future clinical and basic research studies will focus on the validity of the re vised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features of these disor ders including those now being explored by the nimh research domain criteria initiative the medicalacademic field trials were conducted at 11 north american medicalacademic sites and assessed the reliability feasibility and clinical utility of select revisions with priority given to those that represented the greatest degree of change from dsmiv or those potentially having the greatest public health impact the full clinical patient populations coming to each site were screened for dsmiv diagnoses or qualifying symptoms likely to predict several spe cific dsm5 disorders of interest stratified samples of four to seven specific disorders plus a stratum containing a representative sample of all other diagnoses were identified for each site patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a clinical interview by a cli nician blind to the diagnosis followed by a second interview with a clinician blind to previous diagnoses patients first filled out a computerassisted inventory of crosscutting symptoms in more than a dozen psychological domains these inventories were scored by a central server and results were provided to clinicians before they conducted a typical clinical interview with no structured protocol clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying criteria on a computerassisted dsm5 diagnostic checklist determine diagnoses score the severity of the diag nosis and submit all data to the central webbased server this study design allowed the calculation of the degree to which two independent clinicians could agree on a diagnosis us ing the intraclass kappa statistic and the agreement of a single patient or two different clini cians on two separate ratings of crosscutting symptoms personality traits disability and diagnostic severity measures using intraclass correlation coefficients along with information on the precision of these estimates of reliability it was also possible to assess the prevalence rates of both dsmiv and dsm5 conditions in the respective clinical populations the routine clinical practice field trials involved recruitment of individual psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians a volunteer sample was recruited that included gener alist and specialty psychiatrists psychologists licensed clinical social workers counselors marriage and family therapists and advanced practice psychiatric mental health nurses the field trials provided exposure of the proposed dsm5 diagnoses and dimensional mea sures to a wide range of clinicians to assess their feasibility and clinical utility public and professional review in 2010 the apa launched a unique web site to facilitate public and professional input into dsm5 all draft diagnostic criteria and proposed changes in organization were posted on wwwdsm5org for a 2month comment period feedback totaled more than 8000 submis sions which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13 work groups whose members where appropriate integrated questions and comments into discussions of draft revisions and plans for field trial testing after revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposed chapter organization a second posting occurred in 2011 work groups considered feedback from both web postings and the results of the dsm5 field trials when drafting proposed final criteria which were posted on the web site for a third and final time in 2012 these three iterations of external review produced more than 13000 individually signed com ments on the web site that were received and reviewed by the work groups plus thousands of organized petition signers for and against some proposed revisions all of which allowed the task force to actively address concerns of dsm users as well as patients and advocacy groups and ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority expert review the members of the 13 work groups representing expertise in their respective areas col laborated with advisors and reviewers under the overall direction of the dsm5 task introduction 9 force to draft the diagnostic criteria and accompanying text this effort was supported by a team of apa division of research staff and developed through a network of text coor dinators from each work group the preparation of the text was coordinated by the text editor working in close collaboration with the work groups and under the direction of the task force chairs the scientific review committee src was established to provide a sci entific peer review process that was external to that of the work groups the src chair vicechair and six committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to which the proposed changes from dsmiv could be supported with scientific evidence each proposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of evidence for change pre pared by the work group and accompanied by a summary of supportive data organized around validators for the proposed diagnostic criteria ie antecedent validators such as familial aggregation concurrent validators such as biological markers and prospective validators such as response to treatment or course of illness the submissions were re viewed by the src and scored according to the strength of the supportive scientific data other justifications for change such as those arising from clinical experience or need or from a conceptual reframing of diagnostic categories were generally seen as outside the purview of the src the reviewers scores which varied substantially across the different proposals and an accompanying brief commentary were then returned to the apa board of trustees and the work groups for consideration and response the clinical and public health committee cphc composed of a chair vicechair and six members was appointed to consider additional clinical utility public health and log ical clarification issues for criteria that had not yet accumulated the type or level of evi dence deemed sufficient for change by the src this review process was particularly important for dsmiv disorders with known deficiencies for which proposed remedies had neither been previously considered in the dsm revision process nor been subjected to replicated research studies these selected disorders were evaluated by four to five exter nal reviewers and the blinded results were reviewed by cphc members who in turn made recommendations to the apa board of trustees and the work groups forensic reviews by the member s of the apa council on psychiatry and law were con ducted for disorders frequently appearing in forensic environments and ones with high potential for influencing civil and criminal judgments in courtroom settings work groups also added forensic experts as advisors in pertinent areas to complement expertise pro vided by the council on psychiatry and law the work groups themselves were charged with the responsibility to review the entire re search literature surrounding a diagnostic area including old revised and new diagnostic cri teria in an intensive 6year review process to assess the pros and cons of making either small iterative changes or major conceptual changes to address the inevitable reification that occurs with diagnostic conceptual approaches that persist over several decades such changes in cluded the merger of previously separate diagnostic areas into more dimensional spectra such as that which occurred with autism spectrum disorder substance use disorders sexual dys functions and somatic symptom and related disorders other changes included correcting flaws that had become apparent over time in the choice of operational criteria for some disor ders these types of changes posed particular challenges to the src and cphc review pro cesses which were not constructed to evaluate the validity of dsmiv diagnostic criteria however the dsm5 task force which had reviewed proposed changes and had responsi bility for reviewing the text describing each disorder contemporaneously with the work groups during this period was in a unique position to render an informed judgment on the sci entific merits of such revisions furthermore many of these major changes were subject to field trial testing although comprehensive testing of all proposed changes could not be accommo dated by such testing because of time limitations and availability of resources a final recommendation from the task force was then provided to the apa board of trustees and the apa assemblys committee on dsm5 to consider some of the clinical utility and feasibility features of the proposed revisions the assembly is a deliberative 10 introduction body of the apa representing the district branches and wider membership that is com posed of psychiatrists from throughout the united states who provide geographic prac tice size and interestbased diversity the committee on dsm5 is a committee made up of a diverse group of assembly leaders following all of the preceding review steps an executive summi t committee session was held to consolidate input from review and assembly committee chairs task force chairs a forensic advisor and a statistical advisor for a preliminary review of each disor der by the assembly and apa board of trustees executive committees this preceded a preliminary review by the full apa board of trustees the assembly voted in november 2012 to recommend that the board approve the publication of dsm5 and the apa board of trustees approved its publication in december 2012 the many experts reviewers and advisors who contributed to this process are listed in the appendix organizational structure the individual disorder definitions that constitute the operationalized sets of diagnostic criteria provide the core of dsm5 for clinical and research purposes these criteria have been subjected to scientific review albeit to varying degrees and many disorders have un dergone field testing for interrater reliability in contrast the classification of disorders the way in which disorders are grouped which provides a highlevel organization for the man ual has not generally been thought of as scientifically significant despite the fact that judg ments had to be made when disorders were initially divided into chapters for dsmiii dsm is a medical classification of disorders and as such serves as a historically deter mined cognitive schema imposed on clinical and scientific information to increase its com prehensibility and utility not surprisingly as the foundational science that ultimately led to dsmiii has approached a halfcentury in age challenges have begun to emerge for cli nicians and scientists alike that are inherent in the dsm structure rather than in the de scription of any single disorder these challenges include high rates of comorbidity within and across dsm chapters an excessive use of and need to rely on not otherwise specified nos criteria and a growing inability to integrate dsm disorders with the results of ge netic studies and other scientific findings as the apa and the who began to plan their respective revisions of the dsm and the international classification of disorders icd both considered the possibility of improving clinical utility eg by helping to explain apparent comorbidity and facilitating scientific investigation by rethinking the organizational structures of both publications in a linear system designated by alphanumeric codes that sequence chapters according to some ra tional and relational structure it was critical to both the dsm5 task force and the who international advisory group on the revision of the icd10 section on mental and behav ioral disorders that the revisions to the organization enhance clinical utility and remain within the bounds of wellreplicated scientific information although the need for reform seemed apparent it was important to respect the state of the science as well as the chal lenge that overly rapid change would pose for the clinical and research communities in that spirit revision of the organization was approached as a conservative evolutionary di agnostic reform that would be guided by emerging scientific evidence on the relationships between disorder groups by reordering and regrouping the existing disorders the re vised structure is meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives and to encourage research ers to identify the psychological and physiological crosscutting factors that are not bound by strict categorical designations the use of dsm criteria has the clear virtue of creating a common language for com munication between clinicians about the diagnosis of disorders the official criteria and disorders that were determined to have accepted clinical applicability are located in sec tion ii of the manual however it should be noted that these diagnostic criteria and their introduction 11 relationships within the classification are based on current research and may need to be modified as new evidence is gathered by future research both within and across the do mains of proposed disorders conditions for further study described in section iii",
